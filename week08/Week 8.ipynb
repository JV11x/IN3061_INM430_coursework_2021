       " 'True or false, that which\\r\\nis said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and\\r\\nabove all in their destinies, as that which they do.',\n",
       " 'M. Myriel was the\\r\\nson of a councillor of the Parliament of Aix; hence he belonged to the\\r\\nnobility of the bar.',\n",
       " 'It was said that his father, destining him to be\\r\\nthe heir of his own post, had married him at a very early age, eighteen\\r\\nor twenty, in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent\\r\\nin parliamentary families.',\n",
       " 'In spite of this marriage, however, it was\\r\\nsaid that Charles Myriel created a great deal of talk.',\n",
       " 'He was well\\r\\nformed, though rather short in stature, elegant, graceful, intelligent;\\r\\nthe whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the\\r\\nworld and to gallantry.',\n",
       " 'The Revolution came; events succeeded each other with precipitation;\\r\\nthe parliamentary families, decimated, pursued, hunted down, were\\r\\ndispersed.',\n",

       " 'Was he, in the\\r\\nmidst of these distractions, these affections which absorbed his life,\\r\\nsuddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which\\r\\nsometimes overwhelm, by striking to his heart, a man whom public\\r\\ncatastrophes would not shake, by striking at his existence and his\\r\\nfortune?',\n",
       " 'No one could have told: all that was known was, that when he\\r\\nreturned from Italy he was a priest.',\n",
       " 'In 1804, M. Myriel was the Curé of B—— [Brignolles].',\n",
       " 'He was already\\r\\nadvanced in years, and lived in a very retired manner.',\n",
       " 'About the epoch of the coronation, some petty affair connected with his\\r\\ncuracy—just what, is not precisely known—took him to Paris.',\n",
       " 'Among other\\r\\npowerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his parishioners\\r\\nwas M. le Cardinal Fesch.',\n",

       " 'Each of us can profit by it.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat very evening, the Emperor asked the Cardinal the name of the Curé,\\r\\nand some time afterwards M. Myriel was utterly astonished to learn that\\r\\nhe had been appointed Bishop of D——\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat truth was there, after all, in the stories which were invented as\\r\\nto the early portion of M.

       " 'He was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop, and because he\\r\\nwas a bishop.',\n",
       " 'But after all, the rumors with which his name was\\r\\nconnected were rumors only,—noise, sayings, words; less than\\r\\nwords—_palabres_, as the energetic language of the South expresses it.',\n",
       " 'However that may be, after nine years of episcopal power and of\\r\\nresidence in D——, all the stories and subjects of conversation which\\r\\nengross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into\\r\\nprofound oblivion.',\n",
       " 'No one would have dared to mention them; no one\\r\\nwould have dared to recall them.',\n",
       " 'M. Myriel had arrived at D—— accompanied by an elderly spinster,\\r\\nMademoiselle Baptistine, who was his sister, and ten years his junior.',\n",

       " 'Mademoiselle Baptistine was a long, pale, thin, gentle creature; she\\r\\nrealized the ideal expressed by the word “respectable”; for it seems\\r\\nthat a woman must needs be a mother in order to be venerable.',\n",
       " 'She had\\r\\nnever been pretty; her whole life, which had been nothing but a\\r\\nsuccession of holy deeds, had finally conferred upon her a sort of\\r\\npallor and transparency; and as she advanced in years she had acquired\\r\\nwhat may be called the beauty of goodness.',\n",
       " 'What had been leanness in\\r\\nher youth had become transparency in her maturity; and this diaphaneity\\r\\nallowed the angel to be seen.',\n",
       " 'She was a soul rather than a virgin.',\n",
       " 'Her\\r\\nperson seemed made of a shadow; there was hardly sufficient body to\\r\\nprovide for sex; a little matter enclosing a light; large eyes forever\\r\\ndrooping;—a mere pretext for a soul’s remaining on the earth.',\n",
       " 'Madame Magloire was a little, fat, white old woman, corpulent and\\r\\nbustling; always out of breath,—in the first place, because of her\\r\\nactivity, and in the next, because of her asthma.',\n",
       " 'On his arrival, M. Myriel was installed in the episcopal palace with\\r\\nthe honors required by the Imperial decrees, which class a bishop\\r\\nimmediately after a major-general.',\n",
       " 'The mayor and the president paid the\\r\\nfirst call on him, and he, in turn, paid the first call on the general\\r\\nand the prefect.',\n",

       " 'This palace was a genuine seignorial residence.',\n",
       " 'Everything about\\r\\nit had a grand air,—the apartments of the Bishop, the drawing-rooms,\\r\\nthe chambers, the principal courtyard, which was very large, with walks\\r\\nencircling it under arcades in the old Florentine fashion, and gardens\\r\\nplanted with magnificent trees.',\n",
       " 'In the dining-room, a long and superb\\r\\ngallery which was situated on the ground floor and opened on the\\r\\ngardens, M.

       " 'The portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this\\r\\napartment; and this memorable date, the 29th of July, 1714, was there\\r\\nengraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble.',\n",
       " 'The hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story, with a\\r\\nsmall garden.',\n",
       " 'Three days after his arrival, the Bishop visited the hospital.',\n",
